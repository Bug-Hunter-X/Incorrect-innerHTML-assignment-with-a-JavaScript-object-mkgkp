This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the use of innerHTML.  The bug.html file showcases the error, while bugSolution.html provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when attempting to directly assign a JavaScript object to the innerHTML property of an element, which is incorrect. InnerHTML expects a string. The solution involves converting the object to a string representation before assigning it to innerHTML or using alternative methods like textContent for non-HTML content.
